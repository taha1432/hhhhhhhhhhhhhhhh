    <div class="note1"> Are all Football Pitches have the same size? </div>
    <div class="note2">A football pitch (also known as a football field) is the playing surface for the game of association football. Its dimensions and markings are defined by Law 1 of the Laws of the Game, "The Field of Play".
      The pitch is typically made of natural turf or artificial turf, although amateur and recreational teams often play on dirt fields.
      Artificial surfaces must be green in colour. The most famous football stadiums in the world are: santiago bernabéu, san siro, camp nou, etc.
